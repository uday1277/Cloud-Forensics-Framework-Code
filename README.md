🕵️‍♂️ Cloud Forensics Framework
This project is a Python-based framework designed to automate forensic investigations in cloud environments. It enables security analysts to collect, analyze, and respond to cloud security incidents effectively using cloud-native tools and machine learning-based anomaly detection.

🚀 Key Features
Log Collection: Automatically retrieves logs from AWS CloudTrail, Azure Monitor, or GCP Logging.

Anomaly Detection: Uses machine learning algorithms to identify suspicious activities such as unauthorized access, unusual login times, or data exfiltration attempts.

Evidence Preservation: Maintains data integrity with hashing and timestamps, ensuring chain of custody for legal compliance.

Forensic Reporting: Generates structured reports highlighting security threats, affected accounts, IP addresses, and event timelines.

Alert System: Sends real-time notifications when threats are detected.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: boto3, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, pyshark

Cloud Platforms: AWS, Azure, GCP

Forensic Tools: Volatility, The Sleuth Kit

Visualization: Matplotlib, Elasticsearch, Kibana
